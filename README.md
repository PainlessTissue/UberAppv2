# UberAppv2
An improved version of my uber app, redone with a focus on classes

An improvement on the UberCloneApp located on my profile. As said in the description, this uses a focus on classes rather than just
Parse Server objects. 

Each class is a ParseObject, but they store their own information in a different way than if I just used ParseObjects

App is not fully functioning as of yet, but all necessary code is there to run the app without crashes

This app uses Parse Server to store data in the cloud. All necessary files are in the repository 
except the necessary Parse class to make the connection to my server. This file isn't uploaded due to security reasons.
